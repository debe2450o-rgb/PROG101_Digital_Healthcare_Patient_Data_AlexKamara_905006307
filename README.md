# PROG101 — Digital Healthcare Patient Data Management System

Project: Digital Healthcare Patient Data Management System (DHPDMS)  
Student: Alex Alimamy Debe Kamara
Student ID: 905006307  
Course: PROG101 — Principles of Programming Logic and Design  
Institution: Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Sierra Leone  
Examiner: Elijah Fullah  

## Overview

DHPDMS is a classroom logic prototype for a lightweight, offline-first digital patient-record workflow in Sierra Leone. It supports patient registration, record search, diagnosis/treatment updates, input validation, and a repeating menu. It is designed to demonstrate sequence, selection, repetition, functions, modularity, and array searching.

This project contains **no real patient data**. It is not a clinical system. Any real deployment would require authorization, privacy safeguards, role-based access, encryption, audit logs, consent and data-retention rules, clinical validation, backups, and interoperability with approved health systems.

## SDG alignment

- SDG 3 — Good Health and Well-being: supports faster retrieval and continuity of health information.
- SDG 9 — Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:** demonstrates adaptable, open digital infrastructure for public services.

## Modules

- `Main` — controls the menu loop.
- `RegisterPatient` — validates and stores new demographic and medical information.
- `SearchPatient` — searches the patient-ID array and displays a matching record.
- `UpdateRecord` — locates a patient and appends a diagnosis/treatment note.
- `FindPatientIndex` — reusable sequential-search function.
- `ValidatePatientInput` — prevents blank IDs, impossible ages, and empty names.
